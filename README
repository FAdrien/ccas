CCAS v0.1
---------

A simple CAS written entirely in C.

The aim of the library is to implement asymptotically fast algorithms, but not
to do any insane optimisations. All the code is maximally readable, for
teaching purposes.

We try to have classical algorithms, algorithms with divide and conquer
complexity and algorithms with optimal asymptotics, e.g. FFT style algorithms.

Currently Toom-Cook and Lehmer GCD are not implemented. It is questionable
whether these belong in a library focused on simplicity.

Performance measurements suggest that with asserts turned on (see config.h)
the code is approximately 5-10 times slower than GMP up to operations with
a billion bits or so (where cache misses start to slow things down a lot).

There are sure to be many bugs currently. There is no test code. Do not rely
on this code for anything important.
